App.py was based from https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/flask-starter-app.
All code is based on the CS 340 starter code with the exception of some jinja2 functions.
Functions in jinja2 were based on intructions from https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/.
Actual writing of jinja2 functions, as well as custom queries to display names in the spot of IDs for better data understanding was entirely our own work.
